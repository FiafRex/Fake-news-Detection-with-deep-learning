# Fake-news-Detection-with-deep-learning
This project will seek to detect fake news articles by looking out for keywords (such as "POPE", "TRUMP" etc.) from news sites (with sufficiently large datasets) and then comparing them to a dataset (from Kaggle). The model has been trained to report an avg accuracy of 90%.
